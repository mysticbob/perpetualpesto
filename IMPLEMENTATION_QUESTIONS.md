# ‚ùì Implementation Questions & Decisions Needed

## ü§ñ AI Model & Integration

### 1. **AI Model Selection**
- [ ] **OpenAI GPT-4** - Better at structured data, good function calling
- [ ] **Anthropic Claude 3** - Better at nuanced understanding, cooking knowledge
- [ ] **Both** - Use GPT-4 for structured planning, Claude for recipe creativity

**Question**: Which AI model should we prioritize? Do you have API keys for either/both?

### 2. **AI Hosting Strategy**
- [ ] **Local AI Orchestrator** - Runs as separate service on your server
- [ ] **Edge Functions** - Deployed to Vercel/Cloudflare
- [ ] **Integrated in Backend** - Part of main API server

### 10. **Dietary Restrictions Handling**
- [ ] Hard restrictions (never show these)
- [ ] Soft preferences (deprioritize but allow)
- [ ] Allergy alerts with substitutions
- [ ] Per-meal flexibility

**Question**: How strict should dietary restriction enforcement be?

## üì± Platform & Access

### 11. **Primary Platform**
- [ ] **Web only** - Desktop/tablet focus
- [ ] **Mobile web** - Responsive design priority
- [ ] **Progressive Web App** - Installable, offline capable
- [ ] **Native mobile app** - iOS/Android

**Question**: How do you primarily want to access the system?

### 12. **Offline Capabilities**
- [ ] Full offline mode with sync
- [ ] Read-only offline access
- [ ] No offline needed
- [ ] Shopping list only offline

**Question**: Do you need offline access? For which features?

## üîÑ Migration & Import

### 13. **Existing Data Import**
- [ ] Current recipes in database
- [ ] Recipes from other apps (which ones?)
- [ ] Shopping history
- [ ] Meal planning history
- [ ] Start fresh

**Question**: What existing data should we migrate?

### 14. **Recipe Import Sources**
- [ ] Any URL (current capability)
- [ ] Specific sites only
- [ ] PDF cookbooks
- [ ] Photo/scan of recipes
- [ ] Voice input

**Question**: How do you typically get new recipes?

## üí° Smart Features

### 15. **Expiration Predictions**
- [ ] Use standard database (built-in)
- [ ] Learn from user behavior
- [ ] Crowd-sourced data
- [ ] Conservative estimates

**Question**: How aggressive should expiration warnings be?

### 16. **Leftover Management**
- [ ] Automatic lunch planning
- [ ] Freeze reminders
- [ ] Repurpose suggestions
- [ ] Waste tracking
- [ ] All of the above

**Question**: How do you typically handle leftovers?

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Decisions

### 17. **Database Location**
- [ ] Keep PostgreSQL local
- [ ] Move to Cloud SQL
- [ ] Use Supabase
- [ ] Other: ___________

**Question**: Where should the production database live?

### 18. **Image Storage**
- [ ] Local file system
- [ ] Cloud Storage (Google/AWS)
- [ ] Cloudinary
- [ ] No image storage

**Question**: Do you want to store recipe/food photos?

## üìà Analytics & Reporting

### 19. **Tracking & Reports**
- [ ] Nutritional goals tracking
- [ ] Budget vs actual spending
- [ ] Waste reduction metrics
- [ ] Cooking frequency
- [ ] Shopping patterns

**Question**: Which metrics matter most to you?

### 20. **Data Privacy**
- [ ] All data local only
- [ ] Cloud sync with encryption
- [ ] Share anonymized data for improvements
- [ ] Share recipes publicly

**Question**: Privacy preferences for your data?

## üöÄ Implementation Timeline

### 21. **Preferred Approach**
- [ ] **Fast MVP** - Basic features in 2 weeks, iterate
- [ ] **Complete Phase 1** - Full foundation in 4 weeks
- [ ] **Feature by Feature** - One complete feature at a time
- [ ] **Full System** - Everything in the plan (10 weeks)

**Question**: How quickly do you need this operational?

## üìù Additional Considerations

### 22. **Special Requirements**
Are there any specific features or integrations not mentioned that you need?

### 23. **Budget Constraints**
- Development time budget?
- Monthly operational cost target?
- Paid API budget?

### 24. **Success Criteria**
How will you measure if this system is successful?

## Next Steps

Once you answer these questions, I can:

1. Finalize the technical architecture
2. Create detailed implementation tasks
3. Begin building the highest priority features
4. Set up the development environment
5. Create a realistic timeline

**Please indicate:**
- üî¥ **Critical** - Must have for MVP
- üü° **Important** - Should have soon
- üü¢ **Nice to have** - Can wait

This will help me prioritize the implementation correctly.
