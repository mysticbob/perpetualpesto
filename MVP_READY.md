## 🏃 How to Run the MVP

### Step 1: Set Up Environment
```bash
# Add to your .env file:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key-here
```

### Step 2: Start the System
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start database
bun run db:up

# Terminal 2: Start main API server
bun run dev:server

# Terminal 3: Start frontend
bun run dev:client
```

### Step 3: Test Core Features

#### **Add Items to Pantry**
```javascript
// In browser console at http://localhost:3000
fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/pantry', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    userId: 'test-user',
    customName: 'Chicken Breast',
    amount: 2,
    unit: 'lbs',
    location: 'FRIDGE'
  })
})
```

#### **Generate Meal Plan**
```javascript
fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/meal-planning/generate', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    userId: 'test-user',
    weekStartDate: '2024-01-01',
    preferences: {
      planningMode: 'assisted',
      servingsPerMeal: 2,
      maxCookTimeMinutes: 30
    }
  })
})
```

## 📊 Database Status

### Seeded Data:
- ✅ 43 common ingredients with shelf life data
- ✅ Nutritional information from USDA
- ✅ Ingredient substitutions (butter→oil, milk→oat milk, etc.)

### Tables Ready:
- `Ingredient` - Master ingredient data
- `PantryItem` - Your pantry inventory
- `Recipe` - Recipe storage with nutrition
- `MealPlan` - Weekly meal plans
- `PlannedMeal` - Individual meals in plan
- `UserPreferences` - Dietary restrictions, cooking preferences

## 🔥 Quick Test Workflow

1. **Add pantry items** (especially some expiring soon)
2. **Generate a meal plan** - Claude will prioritize expiring items
3. **View the plan** - See how it minimizes waste
4. **Approve the plan** - Makes it active
5. **Check shopping list** - See what you need to buy

## 🤖 Claude Integration

The system uses Claude 3 Haiku for:
- Analyzing pantry inventory
- Identifying expiring items to use first
- Creating balanced meal plans
- Suggesting leftover usage
- Providing cooking instructions

### API Endpoints Ready:

```typescript
// Meal Planning
POST /api/meal-planning/generate     // Generate weekly plan
GET  /api/meal-planning/current      // Get current plan
POST /api/meal-planning/:id/approve  // Approve draft plan

// Pantry Management  
GET  /api/pantry                     // Get inventory
POST /api/pantry                     // Add item
GET  /api/pantry/expiring           // Get expiring items
POST /api/pantry/use                // Mark item as used

// Recipe Suggestions
GET  /api/recipes/suggestions        // Based on pantry
GET  /api/recipes/expiring          // For expiring items
```

## 🎨 Next Steps for UI

The backend is ready. To complete the MVP UI:

1. **Dashboard Component** - Show expiring items, today's meals
2. **Meal Plan View** - Display/approve Claude's suggestions  
3. **Pantry Manager** - Add/remove items, see expiration dates
4. **Shopping List** - Generated from meal plan

## 🐛 Testing the MCP Server

```bash
# Start enhanced pantry server
bun run server/mcp/pantry-server-enhanced.ts

# Test with MCP client
# The server provides:
# - pantry://inventory - Current inventory
# - pantry://expiring - Items expiring soon  
# - pantry://leftovers - Leftover tracking
# - pantry://low-stock - Staples running low
```

## 📈 What Makes This MVP Special

1. **Zero Waste Focus** - Every feature prioritizes using what you have
2. **Intelligent Planning** - Claude understands expiration dates and leftovers
3. **Practical Implementation** - Not over-engineered, ready to use
4. **Real Nutrition Data** - USDA database integration
5. **Flexible Storage** - Different expiration for fridge/freezer/pantry
